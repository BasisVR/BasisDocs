This page was created to assist those seeking to contribute documentation to the BasisDocs repostirory.

BasisDocs uses Docusaurus, currently we mainly use the docs and static directories to serve documentation with images

The quickest way to get up to speed with this site is to follow the 'Create a doc' guide found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc)

Available Markdown formatting information can also be found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)

Thank you in advance for your contributions!
