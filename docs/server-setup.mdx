## Introduction 

The focus here is on Basis Server specific configuration and not the many ways
you can host game servers in the cloud.

The multithreading on the server runs best the more cores avaiable but it has been shown to work well
on as little as two cores. Social VR demands a lot of bandwidth so you'll want to keep that in mind when picking your
service provider. 

This doc applies to an Unmodified Basis Server: Version 6 from the LTS branch  as of May 2025 <!-- `commit 672035f0afe87b2fbe4e36bbd7f6cd340059d976` of lts branch -->

:::tip Helpful Tip about Server Version
You can find the **ServerVersion** in the code you cloned from the repo.  
Client and server code **must agree** on the version.

```csharp
BasisNetworkCore\BasisNetworkVersion.cs
5:        public static ushort ServerVersion = 6;
```
:::

<br />
<br />

### Compile and Run on Windows

Assuming you have cloned the LTS branch of the repo.
`git clone https://github.com/BasisVR/Basis.git`

You will find the Visual Studio Solution file (sln) in the `Basis Server` directory.
These steps assume Windows 11 using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Version 17.12.3


The BasisNetworkConsole is the csproj you will need to target for compiling.
You should be able to select that project from the start up item menu at the top. 
Once selected click the green arrow to build. 

Once compiled, navigate to  `\Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0\`
to find the server exe and compiled dependencies.

To run the server on Windows locally, open a command shell in this directory and run `.\BasisNetworkConsole.exe`

`\Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0> .\BasisNetworkConsole.exe`

This should open a console and show something like the following:

``` title="Example Server Console Output"
[20:07] [INFO] Logs are saved to C:\Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0\Logs\2025-05-10.log
[20:07] [INFO] Server Booting
[20:07] [INFO] HTTP health check started at 'http://localhost:10666/health'
[20:07] [INFO] Loaded Admins 0
[20:07] [INFO] DidAuthIdentity initialized.
[20:07] [INFO] Server Wiring up SetPort 4296
[20:07] [INFO] Server Worker Threads Booted
[20:07] [INFO] CombinedURL: https://example.com/502c8e6c8405d50418.BEE, LoadAssetPassword: c661cfeaf9757e
[20:07] [INFO] Adding Object world
```

 
Be sure to point to `localhost` when running the Basis Demo Client. The option is in the advanced panel when
you first start the client.

<br />
<br />

### Compile and Run on Linux

Assuming Ubuntu 22.04 

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dotnet/backports`

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0`

`git clone`

Open a new terminal and cd /to/directory/with/Basis Server/

`dotnet restore`

`dotnet build`


Navigate to the BasisServerConsole directory (Something like `/BasisServerConsole/bin/Debug/net9.0/BasisNetworkConsole`)
and run: 

`dotnet .\BasisNetworkConsole.dll`



:::tip  For More Targeted Linux Release

You may compile with the following:

`dotnet publish -f net9.0 --self-contained --os Linux`

The `--self-contained` switch is added to allow running on a OS without dotnet installed.

If you compile via this method you should be able to run

`./BasisNetworkConsole`

## Configuration Files

The first time you run the server a variety of config files and structure will be created in
the directory the server exe rests in.

| File/Folder              | Description                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `config.xml`             | Main configuration file for the server.     |

### Loadable Configuration Files

You may setup world and object files to load on demand. 
These are the files you place in the `InitialResources` folder.

:::caution
Note that the remote urls you use must be served from a proper server that supports chunking.
Any modern server should do this but simple local dev servers may not.
:::

| Variable         | Definition |
|------------------|------------|
| `Mode`           | Mode of the configuration: `0` = Game object, `1` = Scene. |
| `LoadedNetID`    |  A Network ID: Server keeps a list of Network Objects that Clients can query and spawn with this value as a reference. |
| `UnlockPassword` | Password required to unlock or access the resource. |
| `CombinedURL`    | URL to the `.BEE` file |
| `IsLocalLoad`    | Indicates whether the resource is loaded locally (`true`) or from the internet (`false`). |
| `PositionX`      | X-axis world position of the object. |
| `PositionY`      | Y-axis world position of the object. |
| `PositionZ`      | Z-axis world position of the object. |
| `QuaternionX`    | X component of the object's rotation (quaternion). |
| `QuaternionY`    | Y component of the object's rotation (quaternion). |
| `QuaternionZ`    | Z component of the object's rotation (quaternion). |
| `QuaternionW`    | W component of the object's rotation (quaternion). |
| `ScaleX`         | X-axis scale factor. |
| `ScaleY`         | Y-axis scale factor. |
| `ScaleZ`         | Z-axis scale factor. |
| `Persist`        | If the player that spawned the object leaves the server does the object continue to exist?  |

        /// just use whatever scale it thinks it is.
        /// </summary>

```
		

<!--
**LoadedNetID**
Server keeps a list of Network Objects that Clients can query and spawn with this value.

**IsLocalLoad**
Does this resource exist on the internet or in the client?

**Persist** 
If the player that spawned the object leaves the server does the object continue to exist?

**Mode**
Mode  0 = Game object, 1 = Scene

## Advanced Server Configuration

### Server Reduction System

As the number of players grows on the server the bandwidth requirements quickly grow. The SRS system attempts 
to reduce the network load and improve performance by slowing down how often it needs to send motion data to players
based on distance.

The equation that governs how much longer the server takes to send Motion Data to users based on distance looks like:

```
 int adjustedInterval = (int)(Configuration.BSRSMillisecondDefaultInterval * (Configuration.BSRBaseMultiplier + (activeDistance * Configuration.BSRSIncreaseRate)));
```

The rest of this section will be published later.

### Client Reduction System

This section will be published later.

## Health Check Endpoint

When running the server locally you may can check the server status by visiting the health check endpoint at:
http://localhost:10666/health


```json title="http://localhost:10666/health"
{
  "listening": true,
  "visitors": "0",
  "capacity": "1024",
  "sent": "0",
  "recv": "0",
  "currentTime": "2025-05-09T20:19:03.200Z",
  "startTime": "2025-05-09T20:19:00.049Z",
  "version": "6"
}
```

| Variable      | Definition                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `listening`   | Is server listening for connections |
| `visitors`    | The number of current players aka visitors |
| `capacity`    | maxium number of players allowed on server |
| `sent`        | Total amount of data sent (in bytes?) |
| `recv`        | Total amount of data received (in bytes?) |
| `currentTime` | The current server time in ISO 8601 format |
| `startTime`   | The server’s start time in ISO 8601 format |
| `version`     | The version number of the server. Important: Client code must match expected ServerVersion |


<br />
<br />

## Terminology

**Local Player**  
The local avatar data that represents _you_ (the user or client).

**Remote Player**  
Represents other players whose data is sent to you by the server.

**Basis Client**
The application you are writing that will communicate with the server.


**Motion Data**
The data that represents the player bone positions as well as position and rotation in the world.
Stored in network serializable format in LASM data structure

**LASM**
Stands for Local Avatar Sync Message, the data structure that contains compressed data
for a players muscles, postion and rotation that is sent over the network.
