# Creating Your Avatar
## Set up the Unity Editor
- As per the [Getting Started](getting-started#installing-unity) section for installing the latest supported Unity editor version and acquiring the Basis framework.
- Open Unity Hub and add an existing project, choose the extracted/cloned Basis project folder
- On the initial project load you will see the following prompt, please hit 'Restart Editor'.
![image](..\static\img\avatars\0.png)
- Once the project has loaded, you can now load in your Avatar files:
- Either,
  - Find `Assets` in the Project hierarchy, inside `Assets` right-click any empty space and select `Show in Explorer`
  - Copy in your Avatar files [Mesh/Materials/Textures, etc.]
- or
  - Import a .unity package containing your files, from the Assets menu, Import Package > Custom Package
- Bring back the Unity window and allow the import process to finish.

:::info
If you place your content within a new directory "Assets > _UserContent" the default .gitignore file with the project will hide changes in git on this folder.
:::

## Import Model
- Find the location of your Avatar model (usually provided in .FBX format).
- Click the file and then navigate to the `Model` section of the Import Settings window.
- Ensure that `Red/Write` and `Legacy Blend Shape Normals` are selected as below.

- Navigate to the `Rig` section of the Import Settings window.
- Click the `Animation Type` drop-down menu and select `Humanoid`, press `Apply` as shown below.

![image](..\static\img\avatars\2.png)

- Afterward, the `Configure` button above `Apply` is now selectable, click this and then check your bone mappings.

![image](..\static\img\avatars\3.png)

- This should show all mandatory bones as selected; make sure this looks correct for your Armature.
- Lastly, click on the `Head` button in the `Mapping` window and remove the assignment for the `Jaw`; this is usually incorrect.

## Skinned Mesh Setup
- There are currently no requirements to name your Avatar's Skinned Mesh as `Body` or other variation used on Virtual Platforms.
- If you have multiple skinned meshes, consider pinning them to all use the same reference point on the body, for inheriting light probes in the scene. You can do this by assigning a bone from the Armature (Usually Hips) to the `Anchor Override` field.

![image](..\static\img\avatars\5.png)

- Another consideration for Avatars with multiple Skinned Meshes is when different bounding box sizes cause individual meshes to pop in and out while the rest of the Avatar is visible to remote viewers.
- You can override the Center X, Y, Z & Extent X, Y, Z values in the section named `Bounds` at the top of the Skinned Mesh Renderer component. Usually, it is a good idea to set this the same across the separate Skinned Meshes.

## Materials/Shaders
- You can jump straight in with the Universal Render Pipeline/Lit shader that comes with Unity 6
- Otherwise, we have compiled a list of compatible [Avatar Shaders](avatar-shaders) that you can use.

## Basis Avatar Setup
- The steps above should automatically add an Animator component to your Avatar prefab when you pull it into the Scene.
- On the Parent GameObject of the Avatar, click `Add Component`, and add `Basis Avatar`.

If you're struggling to find the view ball or indicator for the Eye Position, follow these steps:

- Top Right next to XYZ, click the Eye.
- Enable "Eye Position Gizmo" inside of the `Basis Avatar` component.

You should now see a green Gizmo for your eyes; move this up between your eyes and on the same plane as your eyes.

**Ensure you have assigned each of the following:**
- Animator
- Face Viseme
- Face Blink
- Avatar Name
- Avatar Description

## Jiggles (Optional)
**To add Jiggle Physics:**

At the very bottom of `Basis Avatar`, you will find `jiggle configuration`.
- Click `Add New Basis Jiggle Strain`.

A new `Jiggle Strains` dropdown will appear below it. Follow the dropdowns until you see settings.

- Ensure to add a `Root Transform`.

## Eye & Face Tracking (optional)
***Integrating VRCFT to drive bone rotation via OSC:***

This section will cover usage of Hai's instructions later on.

## Avoid Duplicate GameObjects
- Ensure that there are **NO** duplicate named GameObjects within the hierarchy of your avatar, including the armature, as this will cause your avatar to fail to load after building the AssetBundle.

## Build the AssetBundle
- At the bottom of the Basis Avatar component on your Avatar, check that the appropriate build targets for your content are enabled (Windows, Linux, Android etc)
- Press the 'Create Avatar Bee File' button and wait for this process to complete.

- The results will be opened in a new window automatically as shown below.

:::info
Basis uses the .BEE file extension, which combines the asset bundle and meta data, in order to simplify user generated content.
:::

## Locally Test the Avatar
Testing the .BEE file locally is not yet supported and will be implemented in the near future, please proceed to Uploading Your Avatar.

<!-- - Once the .BEE file has been created, you can load this via the `BootManager` prefab found at `Packages > Basis SDK > Prefabs > Boot`.

![image](..\static\img\avatars\9.png)

- You can place the location of the .BEE file under the `Combinned URL` fields as shown in the example below, along with the `Unlock Password` provided in the `dontuploadmepassword.txt` file generated within the `/AssetBundles/` directory.
- Make sure to tick `Is Local` if the file is not a URL.

![image](..\static\img\avatars\10.png)

- Load the `Initialization` scene from `Packages > Basis SDK > Scenes`, and then hit Play. -->

# Uploading Your Avatar
Basis allows you to load an Avatar .BEE file from a remote URL location, which is also required for other users in a networked session to also load the assets.

In order to support this, you will need to direct link to a remote location. For this example, we will use Google Drive.

(Google Drive supports the direct link of files up to 100MB due to their Virus Scanning policy.)

Upload the **BEE file** to Google Drive, or any hosting provider that allows direct links to files without login.
- Create a Folder on your Drive and set its sharing settings to "Anyone with the link."

Now when you drag your files into this Folder, you will not individually need to set that permission.

- Click the Hamburger Menu on the Top Right of the asset you have just uploaded into the folder.
- Find "Share" and click "Copy Link."

We will need to look into the URL to grab the information we need for your BEE file.

Example:
`https://drive.google.com/file/d/YourIDBringsAllTheLagToMyYard/view?usp=sharing`

We want to copy the unique identifier inside of the URL and add it to the following:
`https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=`

Example:
`https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YourIDBringsAllTheLagToMyYard`

**DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR GENERATED PASSWORD FILE OR SHARE IT**

Load up Basis, open the menu, and select Avatars.
![image](..\static\img\avatars\11.png)

In the Avatar menu, select Add 'Add Avatar' in the top left.
![image](..\static\img\avatars\12.png)

Paste the **BEE File URL** into the field in the next window.
![image](..\static\img\avatars\13.png)

Paste your **SUPER SECRET ENCRYPTED PASSWORD** into the Password field.

Load!

# Remove Avatars
Basis will save the details of Avatars added through the game menu for convenience. Avatars can be removed by clicking on the Avatar in the menu and hitting the Red Delete Avatar button *(Currently no confirmation dialog is shown.)*
![image](..\static\img\avatars\15.png)

To remove all saved avatar information, outside of the game interface, you can also do the following:

- Delete `%appdata%\..\LocalLow\Basis Unity\Basis Unity\VerySafePasswordStore.json`.

When you next reload the game the previously stored Avatars will now be gone.
