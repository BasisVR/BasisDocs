title: Building from Linux
---

:::warning
Linux support is experimental and may have extra issues.
:::
:::note
It is not recommended to build a Windows or Android build from Linux currently as they will likely be missing features or not function at all.
:::

This page assumes you have gone through [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) first.

# Linux prerequisites
:::danger
**Do not commit the removal of the Utilites listed on this doc page!**
They are required for building Windows and Android clients!
:::

In order to build anything Basis under Linux you need to remove `com.meta.xr.sdk.core` "Meta XR Core SDK" and `com.unity.xr.openxr` "OpenXR Plugin" via the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui.html),<br />
You may need to install `com.unity.toolchain.linux-x86_64` "Toolchain Linux x64" but Unity should install that for you.

# Building .BEE files from Linux
For building .bee files for Windows and Android from a Linux Editor you will need to delete the `Assets/Basis/Profiles/HTCViveTrackerProfile.cs` file and set the "Scripting Backend" to `Mono` under `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Configuration > Scripting Backend`.

# Building a native Linux client from Linux
:::tip
It is recommended to change your "Scripting Backend" to `IL2CPP` for better performance.<br />

- Make sure you have [removed the unsupported packages](/docs/linux#linux-prerequisites) first.
- Make sure you *do not* have `Use Scene Provided Here` checked from [World Testing](/docs/worlds#test-the-scene).
- Make sure the `Packages/com.basis.sdk/Scenes/Initialization` Scene is open.

Then build Basis as you would normally.

# Basis VR on Linux
You may need to launch Basis with the `--force-OpenVRLoader` flag for it to function properly in VR:<br />
`./basis.x86_64 --force-OpenVRLoader`

You do not use this when launching for Desktop.

# Proton / Wine
If you wish to use OpenXR with a Windows build under Proton / Wine you can add:<br />
`PRESSURE_VESSEL_IMPORT_OPENXR_1_RUNTIMES=1 %command% --disable-OpenVRLoader --force-OpenVRLoader`<br />
To your Steam Launch Arguments
