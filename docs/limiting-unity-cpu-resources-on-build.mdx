title: Limiting Unity CPU Resource On Build
---

When building a project on Unity 6 it will tend to use ALL of your system resources, leaving it entirely unusable (most notably during the shader compilation stage) even on a high-end machine.

You can use the following as an argument for the launcher to stop it locking every single CPU core to 100%.
`-job-worker-count 8`
Where **8** should be a number less than the total number of real physical CPU cores in your machine. This will limit the Unity child workers to this value, thus disallowing it from locking up every single CPU core. This may even improve the Unity build speed as it tends to end up over-contended and slows itself down.

You can access the launch arguments for a project by opening the Unity Hub and right clicking the project name:

It will then look something like this once you've added the argument:
