## Jiggles (Optional)

**To add Jiggle Physics:**

For each jiggle root:
- Add a new component `Jiggle Rig`, which can be placed in a separate gameObject, but it must under the hierarchy of your Avatar root.
- In the Jiggle Rig component, ensure to set a `Root Transform`, which is a bone in the avatar armature.
- If you have a parent bone (for multiple chains of child bones that you wish to apply the same effect to) you can enable `Motionless Root` to only affect the child bones and not the root itself. (Optional)
- Adjust `Settings` to your liking (activate `Advanced` to view all settings).

**Collision Interaction:**
- Activate `Advanced` to view all settings.
- Enable `Collision` and adjust `Collision Radius` to fit the object.

## Eye & Face Tracking (optional)

- Hai has created a comprehensive guide on how to add the Automatic Face Tracking component to an avatar in a Basis project
- You can follow the link [here](https://docs.hai-vr.dev/docs/basis/avatar-customization/face-trackingsection) for instruction on how this works.
