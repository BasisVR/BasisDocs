## Avoid Duplicate GameObjects

- Basis Avatar will by default rename all duplicate name GameObjects within the avatar's hierarchy. 
<Callout type="warning">
If you enable `Do not auto-rename bones` in the Processing Options. Ensure that there are **NO** duplicate named GameObjects within the hierarchy of your avatar, including the armature, as this will cause your avatar to fail to load after building the AssetBundle.
</Callout>

## Build the AssetBundle

- At the bottom of the Basis Avatar component on your Avatar, check that the appropriate build targets for your content are enabled (Windows, Mac, Linux etc) (NOTE: If building for Basis Framework public testing please use all possible build targets)
- Press the 'Create Avatar Bee File' button and wait for this process to complete.

- The results will be opened in a new window automatically as shown below.

<Callout type="info">
Basis uses the .BEE file extension, which contains your compiled asset and meta data, in order to simplify user generated content.

The .BEE file, along with a randomly generated password to access it, is created under your Unity Project path /AssetBundles/ directory and is hidden from Unity by default.
</Callout>

## Locally Test the Avatar

Testing the .BEE file locally is not yet supported and will be implemented in the near future, please proceed to [Uploading Your Avatar](/docs/avatar/uploading).

{/* - Once the .BEE file has been created, you can load this via the `BootManager` prefab found at `Packages > Basis SDK > Prefabs > Boot`.

- You can place the location of the .BEE file under the `Combinned URL` fields as shown in the example below, along with the `Unlock Password` provided in the `dontuploadmepassword.txt` file generated within the `/AssetBundles/` directory.
- Make sure to tick `Is Local` if the file is not a URL.

- Load the `Initialization` scene from `Packages > Basis SDK > Scenes`, and then hit Play. */}
