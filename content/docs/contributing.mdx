## BasisDocs Contributing Guide

This page was created to assist those seeking to contribute documentation to the BasisDocs repository.

BasisDocs uses Fumadocs, a modern documentation framework. The main directories you'll work with are:

- `content/docs/` - Documentation content in MDX format
- `public/img/` - Static images and assets
