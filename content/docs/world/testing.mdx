## Test the Scene

<Callout type="warn">
Select the `BasisFramework` .prefab asset in the Project files, **Do not instantiate this prefab into the current Scene! The Basis SDK does this automatically!**
</Callout>

- Once the AssetBundle has been created, you can load this via the `BasisFramework` prefab found at `Packages > Basis SDK > Prefabs > Boot`.

- You can place the location of the new AssetBundle under the `Remote BEE File Location` field, along with the `Unlock Password` provided in the `dontuploadmepassword.txt` file generated in the `/AssetBundles/` directory, then enable `Use Scene Provided Here`.
