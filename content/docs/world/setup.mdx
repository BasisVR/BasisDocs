## Set up the Unity Editor

- As per the [Getting Started](/docs#installing-unity) section for installing the latest supported Unity editor version and acquiring the Basis framework.
- Open Unity Hub and add an existing project, choose the extracted/cloned Basis project folder.
- Once the Unity Project has loaded, you can now load your World files:
- Either,
  - Find `Assets` in the Project hierarchy, inside `Assets` right-click any empty space and select `Show in Explorer`.
  - Copy in your World files [Mesh/Materials/Textures, etc.].
- or
  - Import a .unity package containing your files, from the Assets menu, `Import Package > Custom Package`.
- Bring back the Unity window and allow the import process to finish.

<Callout type="info">
If you place your content within a new directory "Assets > _UserContent" the default .gitignore file with the project will hide changes in git on this folder.
</Callout>
