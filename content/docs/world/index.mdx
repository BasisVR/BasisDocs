## Overview

Worlds are the environments where social VR experiences take place in Basis. This documentation will guide you through setting up, building, and testing your own custom worlds using Unity and the Basis SDK.

Basis uses the `.BEE` file format for worlds, which packages your compiled scene and metadata into a single file. Worlds support custom meshes, materials, lighting, spawn points, and can be hosted remotely for multiplayer experiences.
