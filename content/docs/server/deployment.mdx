## Introduction 

The focus here is on Basis Server specific configuration and not the many ways
you can host game servers in the cloud.

The multithreading on the server runs best the more cores available but it has been shown to work well
on as little as two cores. Social VR demands a lot of bandwidth so you'll want to keep that in mind when picking your
service provider. 

This doc applies to an Unmodified Basis Server: Version 6 from the LTS branch as of May 2025 {/* `commit 672035f0afe87b2fbe4e36bbd7f6cd340059d976` of lts branch */}

<Callout type="info" title="Helpful Tip about Server Version">
You can find the **ServerVersion** in the code you cloned from the repo.  
Client and server code **must agree** on the version.

```csharp
BasisNetworkCore\BasisNetworkVersion.cs
5:        public static ushort ServerVersion = 6;
```
</Callout>

## Run with Docker

Using docker-compose is the easiest and fastest way to spin up a Basis server. Docker images of the server are published to github on both `long-term-support` and `developer` branches, under `latest` and `nightly` respectively.

```yml
services:
  basis-server:
    image: ghcr.io/basisvr/basis-server:latest # or :nightly for most recent changes
    container_name: basis-server
    init: true                   # handle process termination
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      SetPort: 4296               # basis port
      HealthCheckPort: 10666      # http healthcheck port
      PromethusPort: 1234         # exists but is unused
      Password: default_password
      PeerLimit: 1024             # 1024 is the maximum supported
      EnableStatistics: true
      EnableConsole: false
    ports:
      - "4296:4296/udp"
      - "10666:10666/tcp"
      - "1234:1234/tcp" # unused
    volumes:
      - ./initialresources:/app/initialresources:ro
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    # exercise health endpoint (optional)
    healthcheck:
      # GET request, void all output.
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --output-document=/dev/null http://localhost:10666/health &> /dev/null || exit 1"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 20s
``` 
Run once to create `config.xml` (under `./config` in the example). Settings in xml will be overridden by environment variables.

## Compile and Run on Windows

Assuming you have cloned the LTS branch of the repo.
`git clone -b long-term-support https://github.com/BasisVR/Basis.git`

You will find the Visual Studio Solution file (sln) in the `Basis Server` directory.
These steps assume Windows 11 using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Version 17.12.3


The BasisNetworkConsole is the csproj you will need to target for compiling.
You should be able to select that project from the start up item menu at the top. 
Once selected click the green arrow to build. 

Once compiled, navigate to `\Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0\`
to find the server exe and compiled dependencies.

To run the server on Windows locally, open a command shell in this directory and run `.\BasisNetworkConsole.exe`

`\Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0> .\BasisNetworkConsole.exe`

This should open a console and show something like the following:

```txt title="Example Server Console Output"
[20:07] [INFO] Logs are saved to C:\Basis\Basis Server\BasisServerConsole\bin\Debug\net9.0\Logs\2025-05-10.log
[20:07] [INFO] Server Booting
[20:07] [INFO] HTTP health check started at 'http://localhost:10666/health'
[20:07] [INFO] Loaded Admins 0
[20:07] [INFO] DidAuthIdentity initialized.
[20:07] [INFO] Server Wiring up SetPort 4296
[20:07] [INFO] Server Worker Threads Booted
[20:07] [INFO] CombinedURL: https://example.com/502c8e6c8405d50418.BEE, LoadAssetPassword: c661cfeaf9757e
[20:07] [INFO] Adding Object world
```

Be sure to point to `localhost` when running the Basis Demo Client. The option is in the advanced panel when
you first start the client.

## Compile and Run on Linux

### Prerequisites Assuming Debian/Ubuntu

For Ubuntu 22.04:

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dotnet/backports`

For Debian or other quirky setups:

```bash
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/12/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

Then continue installation:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0`

### Get Basis

Change to the folder you wish to download Basis to, and execute the following command:

`git clone -b long-term-support https://github.com/BasisVR/Basis`

### Build Basis Server

Open a new terminal and cd /to/directory/with/Basis Server/, i.e. `cd Basis/Basis\ Server`

`dotnet restore`

Then build, with either:

`dotnet build` (for debug)

or

`dotnet build --configuration Release` (for release)

### Executing

Navigate to the BasisServerConsole directory (something like `/BasisServerConsole/bin/Debug/net9.0/BasisNetworkConsole`)
and run:

`dotnet .\.BasisNetworkConsole.dll`

<Callout type="info" title="For More Targeted Linux Release">

You may compile with the following:

`dotnet publish -f net9.0 --self-contained --os Linux`

The `--self-contained` switch is added to allow running on a OS without dotnet installed.

If you compile via this method (or your build targeted the system) you should be able to run:

`./BasisNetworkConsole`

from `BasisServerConsole/bin/Debug/net9.0/BasisNetworkConsole`.

</Callout>

## Firewall

You may want to open ports:
 * 1234/tcp
 * 10666/tcp
 * 4296/udp
