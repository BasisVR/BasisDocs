## Overview

The Basis Server is the networking backbone for your social VR experience. This documentation will guide you through setting up, configuring, and managing your own Basis server instance.

The server is built on .NET 9.0 and uses LiteNetLib for low-level networking. It's designed to handle multiple concurrent players with efficient bandwidth usage and supports both Docker deployments and native compilation on Windows and Linux.
