## Server Reduction System

As the number of players grows on the server the bandwidth requirements quickly grow. The SRS system attempts 
to reduce the network load and improve performance by slowing down how often it needs to send motion data to players
based on distance.

The equation that governs how much longer the server takes to send Motion Data to users based on distance looks like:

```csharp
int adjustedInterval = (int)(Configuration.BSRSMillisecondDefaultInterval * (Configuration.BSRBaseMultiplier + (activeDistance * Configuration.BSRSIncreaseRate)));
```
