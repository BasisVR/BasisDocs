## Health Check Endpoint

When running the server locally you can check the server status by visiting the health check endpoint at:
http://localhost:10666/health

```json title="http://localhost:10666/health"
{

  "visitors": "0",
  "capacity": "1024",
  "sent": "0",
  "recv": "0",
  "currentTime": "2025-05-09T20:19:03.200Z",
  "startTime": "2025-05-09T20:19:00.049Z",
  "version": "6"
}
```
